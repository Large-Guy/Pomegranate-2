# Pomegranate 2

Pomegranate 2 is a full rework of the original Pomegranate Game Engine. It will be designed to allow for a much more
modular and extensible design, with a continued focus on cleanliness, performance and ease of use. The engine will be
designed that individual components can be swapped out for custom implementations, and that the engine can be easily
extended with new features. The engine will be designed to also be as lightweight as possible and to be as fast as
possible. With the new design, the engine will be much more cross-platform as well. (Hopefully)
